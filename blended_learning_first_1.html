        <h5 class="head">Introducing myself and my experience since I first entered college until I met Dr. Muhammad</h5>

        <p class="my-3 head">I am Mohamad Mostafa Alkobrosli, I was a student at the Faculty of Science,
          Department of Geophysics. I am now 29 years old. I entered college in 2011 and graduated in 2016;
          In order to be able to communicate the idea, I wanted to explain what my life was like during my university
           studies because this was the origin that brought the idea of ​​the project to my mind. From the moment I entered
           the university, I was very passionate about science and research, and I was not satisfied with what was taught
           to me at the university, as I searched through the Internet pages for everything new in the subjects I was
           studying. In fact, although this activity is sound and it is self-evident that we encourage any student to do
           it because it indicates diligence and a desire to excel and excel, the winds have brought what ships do not
           desire.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">I was given a choice between two things:
          <p class="my-3 head"><b>The first, </b>
            to be interested in the developed science that is available for free through the Internet provided by the
            largest universities in the world, which if I study it, I will be able to compete with my peers in my field
            of specialization locally and internationally, but I will not get an appreciation, evaluation or recognition
            for this study from the college and therefore I will not be able to succeed or Obtaining a bachelor's degree.</p>

          <p class="my-3 head"><b>The second, </b>
            to be interested in the slow-developing science that is available only within the college system, which if I
            study it, I will hardly be able to compete with my peers in my field of specialization locally and not
            internationally, but I will get an appreciation, evaluation and recognition for this study by the college
            and thus I will be able to succeed and obtain a bachelor’s degree.</p>

        </p>

        <p class="my-3 head">I seriously thought and tried to combine the two things by giving most of my attention to
          the first option, as for the second option, I wanted it just success and gave it some attention on this basis.
          The result is that I was really able to study English with an excellent degree that qualifies me to watch and
          study the lectures presented by major universities such as Berkeley California University and Stanford
          University, because simply because if I did not start the process of sound education by studying English,
          I would never understand what is being said in any lecture or conference I watch in English and I will not
          express what I want to say in the proper way.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">After my mastery of the English language, I began studying the sciences that are freely
          available online, including lectures and scientific references in my field of specialization, and this was
          from one side. From the other side, I got a low grade and failed in some subjects in the first year of the
          college. I was tested in these subjects in the summer term and succeeded in them and persisted with my plan.
          The next year the same thing happened, but in the third year I failed more subjects and the summer term was
          cancelled due to special circumstances this year, and this caused many students to stay an extra year in
          college, and I was one of those students. This was the beginning of my desire to correct my educational path,
          but I did not know how to do this until I met Dr. Muhammad, and he inspired me to the appropriate path at this
          time.</p>
