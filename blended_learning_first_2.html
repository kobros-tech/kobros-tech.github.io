        <h4 class="head">Features and benefits of blended learning</h4>
        <h5 class="head">My activity at the university since I met Dr. Muhammad until graduation </h5>

        <p class="my-3 head">I met Dr. Muhammad and explained to him my goals and my passion for science and we talked
          together about my skills and talent. He asked me a question,<b> “How many percentage of your general activity
            will enable you to succeed in college?”</b> and my answer to him was that 10% of my general activity is
            sufficient to succeed in college and get a satisfactory grade. He said to me at the time,<b> "Oh Mohamed,
              it is not possible to combine two things that are opposite of each other in your mind at the same moment,
              and the system of study in the college is not compatible with the system of study in advanced universities,
              and you must finish one of them, which is studying inside the college and obtaining a bachelor's degree,
              and leaving the other for a while until graduation and to achieve this, only 10% of your general activity
              will suffice you.”</b> I asked him, What about the rest of my general activity? How do I use it? And his
              response was as follows:<b> “Do not give anything of it to study with foreign universities, just use it to
                practice your other talents and skills, such as constantly practicing the game that you have been playing
                since your childhood, which is kung fu, and also restore your skills in drawing and art and develop it,
                and You can also participate in scouting, as it is a game that develops many skills, the most important
                of which is social relations and teamwork, use the rest of 90% of your activity in this matter, because,
                Mohamed, after you graduate and get your bachelor’s degree, you will return to study with major
                universities with full strength, with all your energy and your interest; and you will be able to reach your
                ambition.The college certificate, Mohamed, is only a key to entering the first door towards implementing
                your ideas and creativity in society, as for your skills and talents that you will develop over the next two
                years, it will open the rest of the doors for you.”</b> and the meeting between us ended with an agreement
                on what he advised me to do.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">Indeed, I implemented the advice completely in one letter and joined the university team in the
          scouts. I was responsible for drawing in the roving team, and we camped in the scout camp throughout the school
          year, training in scouting methods until the time for the University Youth Week competition came, and I had to
          participate in it because I am an essential member of elected. Unfortunately, the competition schedule conflicted
          with the schedule of my practical exams in the college, and the Geology Department refused to grant me an
          exception to take my exam after the end of the competition. I apologized very much to the director of the team,
          but he grieved and reacted spontaneously to me, and the rest of my colleagues in the team participated in this
          competition, and they achieved first place at the level of Egyptian universities, and I am very proud of them and
          myself despite the obstacle that prevented me from participating.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">As for sports, I have practiced karate since the age of five and have been practicing kung fu
          since the age of ten, but I did not have the opportunity to participate in any Federation or participate in any
          competition. At the university, I implemented Dr. Muhammad ’s advice related to sports, so I went to one of the
          best kung fu trainers in Egypt, Captain Muhammad Soliman, who was one of the Egyptian national team players and
          there were those who trained with him who became world champions. I practiced kung fu with Captain Muhammad
          Soliman for the remaining two years at the university. I was not sure that I would be able to participate in the
          national championship because it might conflict with the examination schedule, such as what happened in the
          university’s scouting team, so I did not participate in the Kung Fu Federation and did not enter any tournament.
          There was also a club in the university that I participated in and practiced swimming for a short period and also
          practiced taekwondo for two years and participated in the Taekwondo Federation in the hope that I will enter the
          university team in taekwondo and participate in the university youth week, but there is no need to repeat what
          happened.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">My life during the last two years in college was a full time scout camp and we stayed in
          tents. When a lecture or lab was scheduled in the college, I would go to receive the lecture or lab and return
          directly to the camp. When it came time to practice kung fu, I would go to practice for two hours and then go back
          to camp. When it was time to practice taekwondo, I would also go to training for two hours and then go back to
          camp. For the record, taekwondo training was during a month, and kung fu training was during the next month, and
          so on. When it was time to study, I did not study in the camp, but I would go home to study for an hour or two and
          then go back to sleep in the camp.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">In the third year of the college, I got a very good general grade, and in the fourth year I got
          an excellent general grade, and the general grade in my bachelor's degree was good. I would like to mention one of
          the subjects that I was required to do in the fourth year, which is the research subject and the article, because
          I can make the research in any subject I like and in the field I like in the way I like. Indeed, I chose one of
          the respected doctors, Dr. Ibrahim Korat, and registered with him the research, and it was in the field of
          earthquakes. At that time, I said to myself, This is an appropriate moment to apply what I have learned with
          foreign universities in this research, and I suggested to Dr. Ibrahim to make the research practical, not just
          theoretical talk, and it will be in determining the epicenter of the earthquake and the moment of its launch. I
          know that this is already known to the world, but in the college we do not practice a practical activity like
          this. The study is 95% theoretical and my initiation to do an applied research like this is something unique. I
          asked Dr. Ibrahim to forgive me if I wrote the research by hand and I applied my studies and work with pencil and
          geometric man. Dr. Ibrahim's response was better than I expected. He said <b>" If you come to me with the
            research, it is one handwritten paper with one equation of your creativity that will take the full
            degree "</b>. He asked me not to stress myself too much in completing this research. I told him, yes, I will not
            waste my interest in the rest of my studies, and the research will not take more than its due. I thought about
            it and got creative and came up with inventing new equations to locate the epicenter of the earthquake. The
            research consisted of three papers, not one. I got an excellent grade in this subject, and only two of us got
            the same grade in the research subject and the article, me and my friend Ahmed Mounir, who was one of the first
            high school students at the level of the Republic.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">It occurred to me to send this
          <a href="https://www.academia.edu/42882633/An_alternative_method_in_locating_earthquakes_epicenter_and_origin_time" target="_blank">research</a>
           to a foreign scientific journal for evaluation and publication if possible, and this behavior was a pivotal point in
           my life after graduation. I received the reply from the professor who reviewed the
           <a href="https://www.academia.edu/42882633/An_alternative_method_in_locating_earthquakes_epicenter_and_origin_time" target="_blank">research</a>
            and there were many hiccups in it that I would never have known. I felt from his words that I was just an amateur and
            not an expert, despite the fact that I obtained a bachelor’s degree in science, but it did not protect me from his
            criticism of the
            <a href="https://www.academia.edu/42882633/An_alternative_method_in_locating_earthquakes_epicenter_and_origin_time" target="_blank">research</a>.
            This idea that I came up with, which is new and unknown to the college, he was saying about it was discovered 100
            years ago.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head"><b>" Oh my God, the creative idea in my community has been known in the outside community for 100
          years. How can I pass this hundred years? And how can I be on the same level as the international student and compete
          with him? "</b>, These were the questions that I got out of my experience with the foreign magazine, and I have
          sought answers to these questions since my graduation.</p>
