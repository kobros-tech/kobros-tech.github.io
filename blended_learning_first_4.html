        <h4 class="head">Features and benefits of blended learning</h4>
        <h5 class="head">How did I start learning on a sound basis after graduation and what was the desired goal? </h5>

        <p class="my-3 head">I have been trying to get to the answers to the questions that have been on my mind since the response of the reviewing professor to my research in the foreign scientific journal. Several years passed in which I was trying to establish myself in any field in which I could earn a living and get married, and during this period I was not preoccupied with reading and learning because the challenge was relatively difficult to stay in a satisfactory job and get a good wife until the situation is relatively stable after marriage.</p>

        <p class="my-3 head">After marriage, I started reading and going back to online learning, but in a different way from what I had thought in my college days. I had two options:
          <p class="my-3 head"><b>The first, </b>
            To continue studying what I started in college and study what I dreamed of, such as geophysics, nuclear physics, or even electromagnetism. I had ideas in my college years such as to invent the atomic bomb or to invent civilian, scientific and military radar devices such as the GPR device that we use in archaeology; But this matter will cost me time, effort and money, and I will need support from large parties in implementing it if possible. My work was very hard and mentally and muscularly tiring. I was working as a clothes dyer and I was responsible for making the dye formula to get the perfect color tone that satisfies the foreign client. My work was not rewarding enough, especially after I had a baby, and I had to provide for a living in any way possible, and striving in this way would threaten the survival of the family, so I did not pay attention to this option.
          </p>
        
          <p class="my-3 head"><b>The second, </b>
            To study the science that might change my career path and make it easier for me to get the rewarding work that comforts me and my family. I first thought that I would teach physics to high school students through Facebook and YouTube for free, in the hope that if some students like what I teach, someone might call me to teach him the subject for a satisfactory fee for me and him. Very few contacted me and with no real seriousness about learning with me I thought of doing something else. I searched for many ways to develop myself and raise my family socially by investing in myself by learning a talent to work with and earning a living from it. I found on the Internet a website for a German company that works in testing websites and discovers the errors in it. This company is called test IO. This company trains those who participate in it to test websites and after they pass a stage of learning, they are examined and evaluated. After success, they work in testing websites based on what they know. The more a person progresses in learning, the more he progresses in work and gets higher wages. My work with test IO was explaining my circumstances and my goal of learning which is to learn to work and get enough money. Through some work experience, I wanted to be interested in getting a better job, which is developing and programming websites, not just testing them. Since this idea came to me, I started to learn the programming languages ​​of web pages, and a course presented by Harvard University in the field of computer science appeared in front of me called CS50, and this course is considered free unless I wanted to obtain an accredited certificate in it from Harvard University. I registered for this course and began to study it, and this course was considered the first subject that anyone who wants to become a programmer should study at the level of any international programmer. The field of programming and web development was the most appropriate for my physical and social conditions, because in order to learn, I would not need labs or training anywhere, I only need a computer and the Internet in order to learn everything I want and work with it as well. I was very impressed with the Indians, as many of them work in programming and many developed countries depend on Indian programmers. I loved applying the Indian experience to myself. India has a very large number of poor people, and many of them work in the field of programming to get a better life. Indeed, Indians have become world leaders in the field of programming.
          </p>
        </p>

        <p class="my-3 head">With time, I found on the Internet a complete and free educational path parallel to the university educational path. This path was created by a team from MIT University and is constantly being updated. This track includes three majors, the first of which is computer science, the second is data science, and the third is mathematics. The path is suitable for any person who wants to obtain a strong and competitive education for any graduate of the largest universities in the world. The courses available in this track are offered by universities such as Harvard, MIT, Berkeley California, and Stanford. Now I have a goal to follow and a path already drawn, and I have nothing but learning, diligence, and proof of my skills with these prestigious universities.
